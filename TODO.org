* for 1.0
** recoll
- tell recoll to index the file when changing tags
- use recoll to print list of tags
- def cmd_execute(options); what benefit would this have that recoll wouldn't
  have?

** documentation
- internal comments
- man page
- help screen
*** web pages
**** user level documentation
- setting up recoll
**** API docs

* eventually
- return proper error codes along with warnings
- command line completion
- implement tag values relations (equivalent, includes)
** color
- optionally color tags
- color filenames using lscolors
- change formatting if stdout is console or a pipe

* maybe?
- use info in other keys, or from a parser, to fill in a tag. Maybe use Recoll
   for this
- interactively tag a file
- an options like -i/-I in rm, or an undo facility (hook into apply_to_files)

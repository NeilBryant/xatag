* eventually
- return proper error codes along with warnings
- command line completion
- implement tag values relations (equivalent, includes)
** color
- optionally color tags
- color filenames using lscolors
- change formatting if stdout is console or a pipe

* maybe?
- --config-dir command line option
- use info in other keys, or from a parser, to fill in a tag. Maybe use Recoll
   for this
- interactively tag a file
- an options like -i/-I in rm, or an undo facility (hook into apply_to_files)

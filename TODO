implement recursive stuff
implement following links
verbosity

make following symlinks configurable

load options
optionally color tags
color files using lscolors?
pay attention to return values    

what about listing files that have certain tags?
ls with tags
probably list file on same line as 
list everything on one line for grepping
list everything on a different line for ... something
print only certain fields when listing

command line completion

print warning if the tag is new, in case of misspellings
check if key:val pair is in special list.  if it is, add it to another field in addition to tag field
add to list of used tags
tell recoll to index the file

line length
tag values relations

anything that prints, give it an out=sys.stdout keyword
error catching (permissions, etc)

maybe a -i/-I option like rm, or an undo facility
